some useful GO CLI commands:

- go version (current running Go version)

- go fmt (formats code)

- go help (list of all commands)

- go mod init example/test

- go run . (runs your code in current directory)

- go build (builds and creates an executable or package)

- go install (compiles the program & builds it)

- go mod tidy
